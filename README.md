# Minecraft-2D
Inspired by Minecraft and Terraria I decided to make a game combining both of their mechanics (kind of).

## What The Game Provides-
1. Infinitely generated world (not procedural) 
2. Memory efficient with constant 60 FPS (As it only renders the required blocks onto the screen)
3. No objective in game
4. Boring
5. And many other features! (Lie)

## Dependancies-
Requires `pygame` to be installed. You can execute the code below in your terminal to install pygame.
```
pip install pygame
```
